    <h2><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>Welcome to the GamingSoon Creatives Resource.</h2>

    <p>GamingSoon is the ultimate destination to get mobile gamers excited about upcoming games. This tool will allow
      game developers to upload assets to be displayed on the GamingSoon website and the GamingSoon app. An Asset Spec
      is available to download in the right hand panel of this page, which serves as templates for a “One Sheet” and a
      “Half Sheet” for game posters. Along with these images, developers should upload high quality game trailers, and a
      summary document which gives a synopsis of the game, as well as release timeframe and estimated price of the game
      (date and price ranges are fine). Feel free to upload any other assets that may get gamers excited. Remember
      interested gamers get notified when the games they select are released! </p>
